Samples for Intel® System Studio
================================

These samples illustrate features of many of the components included with Intel
System Studio. They are organized into folders that correspond to which
component they belong; for example, `compiler` contains Intel Compiler (`icc`)
samples, `gdb` contains Intel Debugger samples, etc.

>   Ignore any instructions within the `readme` files found in the sample
>   folders that reference installing Intel® Parallel Studio or Microsoft\*
>   Visual Studio.

Most of these samples *do not* have a proper Eclipse\* `.project` file for easy
import into the Intel System Studio development environment. For use within
Intel System Studio (i.e., within Eclipse) follow the instructions below.

>   **IMPORTANT!** At this time, these import instructions work *only* with
>   Intel System Studio for Linux.

Copy the Samples to Your Development System
-------------------------------------------

The simplest way to get a copy of the samples in this repo is to [download this
ZIP file][1] and expand it on your development system. Alternatively, you can
`git clone` this repo directly onto your system. See the green **Clone or
download** button for details on how to clone this repo.

Import a Sample into Intel System Studio (Eclipse)
--------------------------------------------------

>   **IMPORTANT!** When you use the import procedure defined below, Eclipse will
>   *"import in place."* This means the sample folder will be converted to an
>   Eclipse project, it *will not* be copied to your Eclipse workspace folder as
>   part of the import. If you want the sample to be located within your Eclipse
>   workspace you must first *copy* or *move* the sample to your workspace
>   folder before importing it.

These instructions will import the sample as a user-managed makefile project.
That is, all compile and link instructions are specified in a `Makefile`
supplied with the sample. This means you must modify the sample's `Makefile` to
make changes to the build process, for example, if you want to change compiler
optimization options. This can be done by opening the sample's `Makefile` in an
Eclipse edit window, since a makefile is an editable text file.

If a sample *does not* include a `Makefile` it cannot be imported using the
procedure described below. In that case, if the sample includes an Eclipse
`.project` file you can use the Eclipse import tool (`File > Import… > General >
Existing Projects into Workspace`) to open that project for use within Intel
System Studio.

>   It is also possible to use the command-line to build these projects, outside
>   of Intel System Studio. That usage is outside the scope of this README.

### Enable "unsupported" wizards

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Window > Preferences > Intel System Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clear the box labeled *"Hide unsupported wizards."* and click the **OK** button.

>   NOTE: on Apple\* macOS\* the Preferences dialog is located in the
>   `Intel(R)System Studio` menu, not the `Window` menu.

### Import as a makefile project

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File > Import > C/C++ > Existing Code as Makefile Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the **FINISH** button.

>   Locate the folder that contains the `Makefile` for the sample you are
>   importing.

### Modify toolchain build details

Make sure you have selected (highlighted) your newly imported project in the
**Project Explorer** window.

Open the project properties so you can fine tune the build commands:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Project > Properties > C/C++ Build > Tool Chain Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the "**Current builder:**" field is configured to use the "**Gnu Make
Builder**."

![](images/gnu-make-builder.png)

Select the **C/C++ Build** item from the list of properties on the left. Make
sure the "**Build Settings**" tab is selected and clear the "**Generate
Makefiles automatically**" checkbox is cleared. Also, be sure the "**Build
directory:**" field points to the root of your project (assuming that is where
the project `Makefile` is located).

![](images/builder-settings.png)

On the same property panel, select the "**Behavior**" tab and clear the
"**Build (Incremental build)**" field so it is blank, as shown in the image
below. Optionally, you can set this field to match one of the build targets
in the `Makefile`.

>   **NOTE:** If you choose to not use the default or "blank" make target you
>   will have to inspect the sample's `Makefile` for options. The precise name
>   of the make targets that can be used depend on how the sample's `Makefile`
>   has been written. Most of the samples have multiple make targets.

![](images/set-makefile-target.png)

### Build and run the project

Now that your project is configured, you can perform a build and run the built
sample as you would with any Eclipse project.

If the blank make target does not work, or does not build what you need, review
the sample's `Makefile` and README files for information regarding the make
targets available in that sample's `Makefile`, and update the make target name
in the "**Build (Incremental build)**" field on the "**Behavior**" tab of the
"**C/C++ Build**" properties panel to match the desired make target.

For example, if you want the Eclipse builder to perform a `make debug` with
your project (assuming `debug` is a valid make target in your sample's
`Makefile`), then change the "**Build (Incremental build)**" field on the
"**Behavior**" tab of the "**C/C++ Build**" properties panel from an empty
(blank) field to one that says `debug`. Now, when you perform a build of your
project it will execute a `make debug` command.

>   The README file inside the sample you have imported may include a
>   description of the make target(s) that can be used with this sample. Usually
>   this information is in a section of the README titled *"for Linux command-
>   line users"*). If the README file is an html file (`readme.html`) you can
>   view it directly in the Eclipse edit window by double-clicking that file
>   within the Eclipse Project Explorer.
